# Mazes

- simple nested folders and files where inside you gain xp

Basically side missions. Some are for beginners to learn system
others are advanced and you'll have to execute files and delete text from them
or other files and folder, and maybe create your own.

Kinda like Mincraft dungeons ;)

use things like `less` to get clues on where to go
too many wrong turns and you can loose xp

Some files require you to install files
